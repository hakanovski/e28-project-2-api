 "specifications": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F. 2.Cut the tofu in half horizontally and lay between layers of paper towels. Place on a plate, top with another plate, and place a weight on top (a 14-ounce can of vegetables works well). Let stand 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, cut the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl. Add the carrots, cabbage, red pepper, scallions, ginger, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, egg, salt, and pepper. Lightly stir to combine. To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth. Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water. Place 1/2 rounded teaspoon of the tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper. Shape as desired. Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth. Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone. Using a steaming apparatus of your choice, bring 1/4 to 1/2-inch of water to a simmer over medium heat. Spray the steamer's surface lightly with the non-stick vegetable spray to prevent sticking. Place as many dumplings as will fit into a steamer, without touching each other. Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes over medium heat. Remove the dumplings from the steamer to a heatproof platter and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all dumplings are cooked."

    "name": "Blueberry Pancakes",

    "ingredients": "2 cups all-purpose flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon baking powder, Fine salt, 1 1/2 cups unsweetened plain soy milk, 1/3 cup virgin coconut oil, melted, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 4 teaspoons vegetable oil, Maple syrup, nut butter or jam, for serving, 1/2 of blueberries",

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk together the soy milk, coconut oil and vanilla in a second medium bowl (don't worry if the coconut oil clumps). Add the soy milk mixture to the flour mixture and gently fold until just combined (it's OK if there are lumps). Add in blueberries. Heat a nonstick griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil. Once the pan is hot, add three 1/4-cup mounds of batter, evenly spaced, and cook until the pancakes begin to bubble and are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook until the underside is golden brown and the pancakes are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes (adjust the heat as necessary for consistent browning). Repeat with the remaining vegetable oil and batter. Transfer the cooked pancakes to the oven to keep warm. Serve 2 per person with maple syrup, nut butter, jam or your favorite topping."
